# Micro-Service-Project

I am building this project as a Micro-services application. There are several goals for this:
1. Learn Spring Boot Framework
2. Learn Micro-services Architecture 
3. Learn Containerization (Docker + Kubernetes)
4. Learn Web Sockets Protocol + Event driven services (Apache Kafka)

Feel free to look around!
